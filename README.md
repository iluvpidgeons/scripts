lowkey I barely know how to use github yet so this is where I save my scripts

quick-launch.sh give you the option to launch either firefox or steam
random.sh asks you if you're a diddyblud mango and if you're not it shuts down in 5 seconds
fnaf3terminal.sh is lowkey a little broken rn but it replicates the terminal from fnaf 3
